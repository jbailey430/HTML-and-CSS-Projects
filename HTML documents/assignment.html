<h2> About American Kennel Club</h2>
<p>Here is a qoute from AKC</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/best-family-dogs/">Many breeds make wonderful family dogs, though some are better suited for suburban and farm families than households living in the city. 
Family dogs such as Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Beagles, and Irish Setters are playful and protective. 
Pugs, Brussels Griffons and French Bulldogs love their families â€“ particularly their laps.
